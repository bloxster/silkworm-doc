Welcome to Silkworm documentation!
===================================

Silkworm is a greenfield C++ implementation of the Ethereum protocol based on the Erigon Thorax architecture. It aims to be the fastest Ethereum client while maintaining the high quality and readability of its source code. Silkworm uses libmdbx as the database engine.

Silkworm was conceived as an evolution of the Erigon project, as outlined in its release commentary.

Silkworm is under active development and hasn't reached the alpha phase yet. Hence, there have been no releases so far.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
